# Noah Fabrick's Challenge 1

This is my folder for week one's challenge.

This challenge was the "Code Refactor" challenge in which I had to take some source code for a HTML/CSS website and make it more accessible. This means adding things such as semantic elements, alt attributes, and explanatory and descriptive comments as well ensuring the code itself follows a logical order.
